# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
I just landed a job as a Data Analyst for a company called PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company. My first assignment is to perform an exploratory analysis on the data from PyBer in regards to their ride sharing. To aid with this process, I will need to create several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data. With resources provided, I will need to show a relationship between the types of cities as it relates to the total number or riders and drivers that use PyBer and the rates the riders pay. This analysis will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib
